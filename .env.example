# Supabase Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Create a `.env.local` file (not committed to git) and set these values
# These credentials are required for the application to function properly

# Your Supabase project URL
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co

# New Supabase projects use a publishable key (starts with `sb_publishable_...`)
# This is safe to expose client-side but should still be managed via environment variables
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_REPLACE_ME

# Backward-compat option (legacy name). You can leave this unset if you use VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY.
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# SECURITY NOTE:
# - Never commit .env.local to version control
# - For production deployments, set these as environment variables in your hosting platform
# - Rotate keys immediately if they are accidentally exposed
